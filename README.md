🧭 Online Retail Sales — Decision Intelligence & Revenue Strategy Analysis

A Full-Stack Business Intelligence Project

Executive Summary

This project demonstrates how integrated analytics can be used to guide executive decision-making around revenue growth, customer retention, and operational efficiency in an online retail business.

Rather than focusing on tools in isolation, the work is structured as a decision-intelligence pipeline — transforming raw transactional data into commercial insights, strategic trade-offs, and prioritized recommendations that leadership teams can act on.

The analysis combines SQL, Python, and Power BI to answer a core business question:

Which levers most effectively drive sustainable revenue growth, and where should leadership focus investment and operational attention?

Business Objective

To identify the key drivers of sales performance and customer value in an online retail environment, evaluate their relative impact, and translate findings into actionable, revenue-focused strategies for growth and retention.

Analytical Approach (End-to-End)

The project follows a full business intelligence lifecycle:

Data Exploration & Validation (SQL, Excel)

Revenue trends across time, geography, products, and customers

Order fulfillment and operational status assessment

Analytical Deep-Dive (Python)

Customer segmentation and repeat-purchase behavior

Revenue concentration and customer lifetime value estimation

Correlation analysis to identify scalable growth levers

Executive Reporting (Power BI)

Interactive dashboards designed for leadership exploration

Focus on “why revenue moves” rather than raw metrics

Strategy Translation

Clear prioritization of growth opportunities

Operational and commercial recommendations grounded in data

Key Insights (What Actually Moves the Business)

1. Revenue Is Seasonally Concentrated

Q4 consistently drives the highest revenue, with November as the dominant sales month.

This creates clear opportunities for inventory planning, marketing timing, and cash-flow optimization.

2. Revenue Is Geographically Concentrated

A small number of countries (USA, Spain, France, Australia, UK) generate the majority of sales.

Broad, undifferentiated global marketing is inefficient; targeted regional strategies deliver higher ROI.

3. A Small Customer Segment Drives Disproportionate Value

91 repeat customers generate a significant share of revenue.

Estimated Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV): $109,050 per customer, indicating strong upside from retention-focused strategies.

4. Product Portfolio Is Uneven

Classic and Vintage Cars dominate revenue contribution.

Lower-performing categories represent either promotional opportunities or candidates for deprioritization, depending on margin structure.

5. Operations Directly Impact Revenue Leakage

While most orders are shipped successfully, cancellations and unresolved orders represent avoidable revenue loss.

Operational friction is a growth constraint, not just a logistics issue.

Strategic Recommendations (Prioritized)

Double Down on High-ROI Markets
Concentrate marketing and retention spend on top-performing countries rather than expanding indiscriminately.

Protect and Expand High-Value Customers
Implement loyalty and personalized engagement programs for repeat buyers to maximize CLTV.

Focus Inventory & Promotion on Revenue Leaders
Prioritize top-selling product lines while using targeted promotions to test demand recovery in weaker categories.

Reduce Revenue Leakage Through Operations
Address causes of cancellations and order delays to convert existing demand into realized revenue.

Advance Toward Predictive Decision-Making
Extend the analytical foundation into forecasting, churn prediction, and market basket analysis to support proactive planning.
